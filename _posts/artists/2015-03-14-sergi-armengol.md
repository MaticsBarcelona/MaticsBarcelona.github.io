##Creative Programming and Digital Artist

My name is Sergi Armengol, I'm an audiovisual engineer graduate at Pompeu Fabra University.
After finishing my degree I was thinking about these 4 years I left behind, and I could see how I needed to start something new, something more creative than an engineering degree. 

At this point I decided to start the MUAD, Master in Digital Art.
Right Now I'm improving my new skills with different programming languages like PHP, Processing, Arduino, Action Script 3, Pure Data and front and back end web programming. 

Also starting with Mapping, visual art with Adobe After Effects and interactive neuro-systems with EEG and some work with robotics.
