Web Developer, UI/UX Designer, VideoMaker, Events Photographer

My name is FRANCESCO MARINO, I am Italian but I have often lived abroad and I
speak english fluently and basic spanish. I love travelling and I can adapt easily to
cultures different from mine. I define myself a 360°CREATIVE, because I join great
practical and learning skills with a broad creativity and the capacity to find new
view points and solutions in different fields.
In IT I have extensive knowledge and the ability to solve problems methodically. My
specialities are Web and Mobile technologies, with back-end abilities but a propensity
for the front-end. I have a personal enthusiasm about the study of the UI and
minimalism, in order to make the UX the best possibile.
About my MULTIMEDIA profile, I can reach professional results in both video making
and photography, taking care of the pre-production and the post-production,
thanks to my natural predisposition in practical organisation, aesthetic care and a
strong passion in story-telling.
I have a strong information retrieving method on the Internet and I am used to taking
complete advantage of all my resources. I am very meticulous, ready to learn,
dynamic, stimulated and self-sufficient, but also able to be cooperative in an
heterogeneous team

## Selected Works: 

###360FUN.net Interactive Design

In 2010 I decided to renew my website and make it really minimalistic but also catchy. My main goal was to make the user feel the weight of the balls when they were falling and the curtain as well.
