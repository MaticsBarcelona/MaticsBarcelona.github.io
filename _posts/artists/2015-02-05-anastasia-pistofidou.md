###Screambox
The ScreamBooth is an installation that detects the scream of one, or various users, and snaps a photo while they are screaming. It uses state-of-the art devices to provide high-quality photographs, shown on the boothâ€™s screen. All the devices, sensors and actuators are built inside a cool-design wooden box.
